I am usually casual and sometime funny in daily life. But I am very serious about doing research. My research interests spread in various fields, including development economics, applied macroeconomics and econometrics, and energy economics. Currently, I am working on interactions between land property rights and resource allocation and their welfare implications for the poor under the guidance of [Michael R. Carter](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/michael-carter/) and [Stephen Boucher](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/steve-boucher/).
