### The Mechanization of Farming on Tiliu Tian Boosts Farmland Transfers: Descriptive Evidence from Household Surveys in Chizhou, Anhui Province.

This paper studies how to boost farmland transfers in China where farmland is fragmented and households have heterogeneous reservation prices for farmland. Self-collected household survey results indicate that the mechanization service on tiliu tian (large and non-fragmented farmland) spreads into chengbao tian (small and fragmented farmland). This spillover effect lowers the labor cost of cultivating small fragmented farmland in scale. Hence, it effectively enhances the demand of land transfer and thereby boosts farmland transfers among households in the villiage.
