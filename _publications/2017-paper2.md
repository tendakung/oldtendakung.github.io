This paper studies the well-known "price puzzle" phenomenon of China's monetary policy effects and empirically finds that it is almost caused by sterilized interventions of the central bank. I employs a non-recursive SVAR model, which explicitly incorporates sterilizing interventions of the central bank, to study effects of China’s 5 main monetary policy instruments including 7-days weighted average interbank interest rate, 1-year benchmark lending rate, required reserve ratio, total RMB loans in financial institutions and money supply M2 on production and infation, using monthly data of primary commodity price index, US federal funds rate and China’s value-added industrial production index, consumer price index, foreign reserves, base money and RMB exchange rate against US dollar during the period from Jan, 2000 to Dec, 2015. Results show that the 5 policy instruments above are all effective: Positive shocks of total loans and M2 can cause industrial production and consumer price to increase in the short run at 10% significance level. However, contrary to the literature, positive shocks of interbank interest rate, benchmark lending rate and required reserve ratio can cause them to decrease in the short run at 10% significance level, i.e. no “price puzzle” which will nevertheless show up if sterilizing interventions are not considered. The latter findings suggest that sterilizing interventions of the central bank contribute to the "price puzzle" phenomenon of China's monetary policy effects.
