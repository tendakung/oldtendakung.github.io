excerpt: 'This paper studies the price puzzle phenomenon of China&rsquo;s monetary policy effects and finds that it is almost caused by sterilized interventions of the central bank. I employs a non-recursive SVAR model, which explicitly incorporates sterilizing interventions of the central bank, to study effects of China&rsquo;s 5 main monetary policy instruments during the period from Jan, 2000 to Dec, 2015. Impulse response analyses show that all the 5 policy instruments are effective and contrary to the literature, none of them exhibits price puzzle which will be nevertheless present if sterilizing interventions are not considered.'
