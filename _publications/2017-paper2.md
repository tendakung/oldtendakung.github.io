This paper studies how the mechanization service on tiliu tian boosts farmland transfers in China where farmland is fragmented and households have heterogeneous reservation prices for farmland. Self-collected household survey results indicate that the mechanization service on tiliu tian (large and non-fragmented farmland) spreads into chengbao tian (small and fragmented land). This spillover effect lowers the labor cost of cultivating small fragmented farmland in scale. Hence, it effectively enhances the demand of land transfer and thereby boosts farmland transfers among households in the villiage.
